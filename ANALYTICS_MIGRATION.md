# Analytics Migration: Aptabase to Countly

## Overview
Successfully migrated the project from Aptabase analytics to Countly with minimal disruption to the codebase.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Dependencies
- ❌ **Removed**: `@aptabase/react-native`
- ✅ **Added**: `countly-sdk-react-native-bridge@25.4.0`

### 2. Analytics Service (`src/services/analytics.service.ts`)
- **Completely rewritten** to use Countly SDK
- **Maintained same interface** for components (same method names and signatures)
- **Enhanced error handling** with retry logic and graceful degradation
- **Added comprehensive session management** (start, end, extend)
- **Proper user properties support**
- **Environment-driven initialization** with fallback configuration

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Event tracking with properties
- ✅ User properties management  
- ✅ Session lifecycle management
- ✅ Error handling with retry mechanism
- ✅ Service status monitoring
- ✅ Graceful degradation on failures

### 3. Hook Integration (`src/hooks/use-analytics.ts`)
- **Updated** to use new `analyticsService` instead of `aptabaseService`
- **Interface unchanged** - components continue working without modifications
- **Performance optimized** with `useCallback`

### 4. Environment Configuration
- **Updated** `env.js` to support Countly variables:
  - `RESPOND_COUNTLY_APP_KEY` (replaces `RESPOND_APTABASE_APP_KEY`)
  - `RESPOND_COUNTLY_URL` (replaces `RESPOND_APTABASE_URL`)
- **Updated** `.env.development` with new variable names

### 5. App Initialization
- **Integrated** analytics service into `AppInitializationService`
- **Automatic initialization** during app startup
- **Proper error handling** - analytics failures don't break app startup
- **Environment-based configuration** - uses env vars automatically

### 6. Removed Components
- ❌ **Deleted**: `src/components/common/aptabase-provider.tsx`
- ❌ **Removed**: All references to `AptabaseProviderWrapper` in `_layout.tsx`
- ❌ **Cleaned up**: Old Aptabase mocks in test files

### 7. Test Coverage
- ✅ **New comprehensive test suite** for `analytics.service.ts` (23 passing tests)
- ✅ **Updated hook tests** to use new service
- ✅ **Cleaned up** old Aptabase references in component tests
- ✅ **All tests passing** for analytics-related code

## Migration Benefits

### ✅ Minimal Disruption
- **Zero changes** required in components using analytics
- **Same API interface** maintained across the migration
- **Existing analytics calls** continue working unchanged

### ✅ Enhanced Reliability
- **Better error handling** with exponential backoff retry logic
- **Graceful degradation** when analytics fails
- **Service status monitoring** with automatic recovery
- **Proper session management**

### ✅ Improved Architecture
- **Centralized initialization** through AppInitializationService
- **Environment-driven configuration** 
- **Comprehensive test coverage**
- **Better logging and debugging**

## Configuration Required

To complete the setup, you need to configure the environment variables:

```bash
# In your .env files (development, staging, production)
RESPOND_COUNTLY_APP_KEY=your_countly_app_key_here
RESPOND_COUNTLY_URL=https://your-countly-server.com
```

## Testing Status

✅ **All analytics tests passing**:
- `src/services/__tests__/analytics.service.test.ts` - 23 tests ✅
- `src/hooks/__tests__/use-analytics.test.ts` - All tests ✅
- Component integration tests working ✅

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Countly server credentials** in environment files
2. **Test in development environment** to verify data flow
3. **Deploy to staging** for validation
4. **Monitor analytics data** to ensure proper tracking

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If rollback is required:
1. Reinstall: `yarn add @aptabase/react-native`
2. Restore: `src/services/aptabase.service.ts` from git history
3. Revert: Environment variable changes
4. Restore: `AptabaseProviderWrapper` in `_layout.tsx`

However, the migration maintains full API compatibility, so rollback should not be necessary.
