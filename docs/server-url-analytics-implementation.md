# Server URL Bottom Sheet Analytics Implementation

## Overview

Refactored the `ServerUrlBottomSheet` component to integrate comprehensive analytics tracking using the `useAnalytics` hook. The implementation tracks user interactions with the server URL configuration form while maintaining error resilience and user experience quality.

## Analytics Events Tracked

### 1. Sheet View Analytics
- **Event**: `server_url_sheet_viewed`
- **Trigger**: When the bottom sheet becomes visible
- **Properties**:
  - `timestamp`: ISO string of current time
  - `isLandscape`: Boolean indicating screen orientation
  - `colorScheme`: Current color scheme ('light', 'dark', or fallback to 'light')

### 2. Form Submission Analytics
- **Event**: `server_url_form_submitted`
- **Trigger**: When user taps save button
- **Properties**:
  - `timestamp`: ISO string of current time
  - `hasUrl`: Boolean indicating if URL field has content
  - `urlLength`: Number indicating the length of the URL string
  - `isLandscape`: Boolean indicating screen orientation

### 3. Form Success Analytics
- **Event**: `server_url_form_success`
- **Trigger**: When form submission completes successfully
- **Properties**:
  - `timestamp`: ISO string of current time
  - `isLandscape`: Boolean indicating screen orientation

### 4. Form Failure Analytics
- **Event**: `server_url_form_failed`
- **Trigger**: When form submission fails
- **Properties**:
  - `timestamp`: ISO string of current time
  - `errorMessage`: Error message string
  - `isLandscape`: Boolean indicating screen orientation

### 5. Sheet Close Analytics
- **Event**: `server_url_sheet_closed`
- **Trigger**: When user closes the sheet via cancel button or backdrop
- **Properties**:
  - `timestamp`: ISO string of current time
  - `wasFormModified`: Boolean (currently set to false, could be enhanced to track form dirty state)
  - `isLandscape`: Boolean indicating screen orientation

## Implementation Details

### Analytics Integration
The component uses the `useAnalytics` hook to track events. All analytics calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks to ensure that analytics failures don't break the user experience.

### Error Handling
Analytics errors are logged to the console with `console.warn` but do not interrupt the normal flow of the application. This ensures a graceful degradation when analytics services are unavailable.

### Performance Considerations
Analytics tracking is implemented using React's `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and optimize performance. Event tracking occurs asynchronously and doesn't block user interactions.

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes Made

1. **Added `useAnalytics` Import**
   ```typescript
   import { useAnalytics } from '@/hooks/use-analytics';
   ```

2. **Added Window Dimensions Hook**
   ```typescript
   import { useWindowDimensions } from 'react-native';
   ```

3. **Added Analytics Tracking Functions**
   - `trackViewAnalytics`: Tracks when the sheet becomes visible
   - Enhanced `onFormSubmit`: Tracks form submission lifecycle
   - Enhanced `handleClose`: Tracks sheet close events

4. **Analytics Triggering**
   - Sheet view analytics triggered on `isOpen` change
   - Form analytics triggered during submission lifecycle
   - Close analytics triggered when user dismisses the sheet

5. **Responsive Design Integration**
   - Tracks screen orientation in analytics data
   - Adjusts button sizes based on orientation
   - Maintains consistent UX across device orientations

### Error Resilience
All analytics tracking is wrapped in try-catch blocks:

```typescript
try {
  trackEvent('event_name', properties);
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Failed to track analytics:', error);
}
```

This ensures that:
- Analytics failures don't crash the component
- Errors are logged for debugging
- User experience remains unaffected

## Testing Implementation

### Comprehensive Test Coverage

#### Basic Rendering Tests
- Verifies component renders correctly when open/closed
- Tests form field properties and configurations
- Validates UI component structure

#### Analytics Integration Tests
- **View Analytics**: Tests tracking when sheet becomes visible
- **Form Submission Analytics**: Tests tracking during form submission
- **Form Success/Failure Analytics**: Tests tracking for different submission outcomes
- **Close Analytics**: Tests tracking when sheet is dismissed
- **Error Handling**: Tests graceful degradation when analytics fail

#### Form Interaction Tests
- Tests loading states during form submission
- Validates form submission lifecycle
- Tests error handling during submission failures

#### Responsive Design Tests
- Tests orientation detection logic
- Validates analytics data includes correct orientation information
- Tests button size adjustments for different orientations

#### Dark Mode Support Tests
- Tests color scheme detection
- Validates fallback behavior for null color schemes

### Test Structure
Tests are organized into logical groups:
- `Basic Rendering`: Core component functionality
- `Analytics Integration`: Analytics tracking validation
- `Form Interactions`: User interaction handling
- `Responsive Design`: Orientation handling
- `Dark Mode Support`: Color scheme handling

### Mocking Strategy
- Analytics hook is mocked to track calls without executing real analytics
- Form submission is mocked to test success/failure scenarios
- UI components are mocked to focus on logic testing
- React Native hooks are mocked for consistent test environment

## Usage Example

```typescript
<ServerUrlBottomSheet
  isOpen={isModalOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsModalOpen(false)}
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **User Behavior Insights**: Track how users interact with server URL configuration
2. **Error Monitoring**: Monitor form submission failures and success rates
3. **UX Analytics**: Understand user preferences (orientation, color scheme)
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track form submission timing and patterns
5. **Error Resilience**: Analytics failures don't impact user experience
6. **Configuration Analytics**: Track server URL changes and patterns

## Future Enhancements

1. **Form State Tracking**: Track form dirty state in close analytics
2. **URL Validation Analytics**: Track validation errors and patterns
3. **Timing Analytics**: Track time spent on form before submission
4. **URL Pattern Analytics**: Track common URL patterns and formats
5. **A/B Testing Support**: Track different form variants
6. **Performance Metrics**: Track form load and submission times
