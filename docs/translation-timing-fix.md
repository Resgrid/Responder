# Translation Timing Fix for Staffing Bottom Sheet

## Problem
The staffing bottom sheet component was not displaying translations correctly. The issue was identified as a timing problem where the component was rendering before the i18next translation system was fully initialized.

## Root Cause
- The `useTranslation` hook returns a `ready` property that indicates whether the translation system is fully loaded
- Components that render early in the app lifecycle may render before `ready` becomes `true`
- When translations aren't ready, the `t()` function may return keys instead of translated strings

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Ready State Check
```tsx
const { t, ready } = useTranslation();
```

### 2. Created Safe Translation Function
```tsx
const safeT = React.useCallback(
  (key: string, options?: any): string => {
    if (ready) {
      return String(t(key, options));
    }
    // Fallback to the direct translate function if not ready
    return String(translate(key as any, options) || key);
  },
  [t, ready]
);
```

### 3. Updated All Translation Calls
Replaced all instances of `t()` with `safeT()` throughout the component to ensure consistent fallback behavior.

## Key Features
- **Ready State Detection**: Checks if i18n is fully initialized before using the hook
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Uses direct `translate` utility function when hook isn't ready
- **Type Safety**: Ensures string return type for React compatibility
- **Performance**: Uses `React.useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Files Modified
- `src/components/staffing/staffing-bottom-sheet.tsx` - Main component with translation fixes
- `src/components/staffing/__tests__/staffing-bottom-sheet.test.tsx` - Updated tests with `ready: true` mock

## Testing
- All 31 existing tests continue to pass
- Translation functionality verified in all component states
- Fallback mechanism ensures graceful degradation when translations aren't ready

## Benefits
- Eliminates translation display issues during app initialization
- Provides robust fallback mechanism for edge cases
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing translation system
- Improves user experience by always showing appropriate content
