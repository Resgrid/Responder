# Protocol Details Sheet Analytics Implementation

## Summary

Successfully refactored the `ProtocolDetailsSheet` component to integrate analytics tracking using the `useAnalytics` hook and updated the corresponding unit tests to ensure they pass.

## Changes Made

### Component Refactoring (`src/components/protocols/protocol-details-sheet.tsx`)

1. **Added Analytics Import**
   - Imported `useAnalytics` hook from `@/hooks/use-analytics`
   - Added `useCallback` and `useEffect` imports for analytics implementation

2. **View Analytics Tracking**
   - Added `useEffect` to track when the protocol details sheet becomes visible
   - Tracks event: `protocol_details_viewed`
   - Analytics data includes:
     - `timestamp`: Current ISO string timestamp
     - `protocolId`: Unique identifier of the protocol
     - `protocolName`: Name of the protocol
     - `protocolCode`: Protocol code (if available)
     - `hasDescription`: Boolean indicating if protocol has description
     - `hasProtocolText`: Boolean indicating if protocol has content text
     - `hasCode`: Boolean indicating if protocol has a code
     - `protocolState`: Current state of the protocol
     - `isDisabled`: Boolean indicating if protocol is disabled
     - `contentLength`: Length of the protocol text content
     - `departmentId`: Department ID associated with the protocol

3. **Close Analytics Tracking**
   - Created `handleClose` function with analytics tracking
   - Tracks event: `protocol_details_closed`
   - Analytics data includes:
     - `timestamp`: Current ISO string timestamp
     - `protocolId`: Unique identifier of the protocol
     - `protocolName`: Name of the protocol
   - Integrated with both close button press and actionsheet onClose callback

4. **Error Handling**
   - Wrapped analytics calls in try-catch blocks
   - Analytics errors are logged as warnings but don't break the component
   - Component functionality remains intact if analytics fail

### Test Updates (`src/components/protocols/__tests__/protocol-details-sheet.test.tsx`)

1. **Analytics Mock Setup**
   - Added mock for `useAnalytics` hook
   - Configured mock `trackEvent` function for testing

2. **New Test Suite: Analytics**
   - **View Analytics Test**: Verifies analytics tracking when sheet becomes visible
   - **Close Button Analytics Test**: Verifies analytics tracking when close button is pressed
   - **Actionsheet Close Analytics Test**: Verifies analytics tracking when sheet is closed via onClose
   - **Error Handling Tests**: Verifies graceful handling of analytics errors (both view and close)
   - **Optional Fields Test**: Verifies correct analytics data for protocols without optional fields
   - **Null Protocol Test**: Verifies no analytics tracking when no protocol is selected
   - **Sheet Not Open Test**: Verifies no analytics tracking when sheet is not open

3. **Enhanced Test Coverage**
   - All existing tests continue to pass
   - New analytics functionality is thoroughly tested
   - Error scenarios are covered
   - Edge cases are handled

## Analytics Events

### protocol_details_viewed
Triggered when the protocol details sheet becomes visible

**Properties:**
- `timestamp` (string): ISO timestamp when event occurred
- `protocolId` (string): Unique protocol identifier
- `protocolName` (string): Protocol name
- `protocolCode` (string): Protocol code (empty string if not available)
- `hasDescription` (boolean): Whether protocol has description
- `hasProtocolText` (boolean): Whether protocol has content text
- `hasCode` (boolean): Whether protocol has code
- `protocolState` (number): Protocol state value
- `isDisabled` (boolean): Whether protocol is disabled
- `contentLength` (number): Length of protocol text content
- `departmentId` (string): Associated department ID

### protocol_details_closed
Triggered when the protocol details sheet is closed (via button or actionsheet)

**Properties:**
- `timestamp` (string): ISO timestamp when event occurred
- `protocolId` (string): Unique protocol identifier  
- `protocolName` (string): Protocol name

## Technical Implementation Details

### Hook Integration
- Uses `useAnalytics` hook for consistent analytics tracking
- Analytics calls are wrapped in `useCallback` for performance optimization
- `useEffect` hook ensures analytics are tracked only when sheet becomes visible

### Error Resilience
- All analytics calls include error handling
- Component functionality is never compromised by analytics failures
- Errors are logged to console for debugging but don't propagate

### Performance Considerations
- Analytics tracking uses `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Analytics calls are lightweight and don't impact UI performance
- No blocking operations in analytics code

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ 28 total tests (20 existing + 8 new analytics tests)
- ✅ Full coverage of analytics functionality
- ✅ Error handling scenarios covered
- ✅ Edge cases tested
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/protocols/protocol-details-sheet.tsx` - Added analytics tracking
2. `src/components/protocols/__tests__/protocol-details-sheet.test.tsx` - Added analytics tests
3. `docs/protocol-details-sheet-analytics-implementation.md` - This documentation

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes to component API
- Existing functionality remains unchanged
- New analytics tracking is transparent to component users
- Component gracefully handles analytics service unavailability
