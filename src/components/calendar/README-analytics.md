# Calendar Item Details Sheet - Analytics Implementation

## Overview
The Calendar Item Details Sheet component has been successfully refactored to include comprehensive analytics tracking using the `useAnalytics` hook.

## Analytics Implementation

### Events Tracked

#### 1. Calendar Item Details Viewed
**Event Name:** `calendar_item_details_viewed`

**Triggered When:** The bottom sheet becomes visible (when `isOpen` becomes `true` and `item` is provided)

**Properties:**
- `itemId` (string): Unique identifier for the calendar item
- `itemType` (number): Type of the calendar item
- `hasLocation` (boolean): Whether the item has a location
- `hasDescription` (boolean): Whether the item has a description
- `isAllDay` (boolean): Whether the event is all-day
- `canSignUp` (boolean): Whether user can sign up (based on SignupType > 0 && !LockEditing)
- `isSignedUp` (boolean): Whether user is currently signed up
- `attendeeCount` (number): Number of attendees
- `signupType` (number): Type of signup required
- `typeName` (string): Name of the event type
- `timestamp` (string): ISO timestamp of when analytics was tracked

#### 2. Calendar Item Attendance Attempted
**Event Name:** `calendar_item_attendance_attempted`

**Triggered When:** User attempts to change their attendance status (sign up or unsign)

**Properties:**
- `itemId` (string): Unique identifier for the calendar item
- `attending` (boolean): Whether user is trying to attend (true) or unattend (false)
- `status` (number): Status code (1 = attending, 4 = not attending)
- `hasNote` (boolean): Whether a note was provided
- `noteLength` (number): Length of the note if provided
- `timestamp` (string): ISO timestamp

#### 3. Calendar Item Attendance Success
**Event Name:** `calendar_item_attendance_success`

**Triggered When:** Attendance status change is successful

**Properties:**
- `itemId` (string): Unique identifier for the calendar item
- `attending` (boolean): Final attendance status
- `status` (number): Status code
- `hasNote` (boolean): Whether a note was provided
- `timestamp` (string): ISO timestamp

#### 4. Calendar Item Attendance Failed
**Event Name:** `calendar_item_attendance_failed`

**Triggered When:** Attendance status change fails

**Properties:**
- `itemId` (string): Unique identifier for the calendar item
- `attending` (boolean): Attempted attendance status
- `error` (string): Error message
- `timestamp` (string): ISO timestamp

## Code Changes

### Component Changes
1. **Added useAnalytics hook import**
2. **Added useEffect for visibility tracking** - Tracks when sheet becomes visible
3. **Enhanced performAttendanceChange function** - Added analytics tracking for attempts, successes, and failures

### Key Features
- **Visibility Tracking**: Analytics are only tracked when the sheet is actually visible to the user
- **Error Handling**: Failed attendance changes are tracked with error details
- **Comprehensive Data**: Rich metadata about the calendar item and user actions
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses useEffect with proper dependencies to avoid unnecessary tracking

## Testing

### Test Coverage
The implementation includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

1. **Analytics Tracking**
   - Tracks analytics when sheet becomes visible
   - Does not track when sheet is not visible
   - Tracks correct data for different item properties
   - Tracks analytics when item changes while sheet is open

2. **Attendance Functionality**
   - Tracks attendance attempts with correct data
   - Tracks successful attendance changes
   - Tracks failed attendance changes with error details
   - Handles note input for signup types that require notes

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Handles null items gracefully
   - Works with items missing optional fields
   - Properly handles loading states
   - Error scenarios are tracked correctly

### Test Files
- `calendar-item-details-sheet-minimal.test.tsx` - Core analytics functionality tests
- `calendar-item-details-sheet-analytics.test.tsx` - Comprehensive analytics tests
- `calendar-item-details-sheet.test.tsx` - Full component functionality tests

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analytics Tracking
```typescript
// Analytics automatically tracked when sheet opens
<CalendarItemDetailsSheet 
  item={calendarItem} 
  isOpen={true} 
  onClose={handleClose} 
/>
```

### Data Analysis
The tracked events can be used to analyze:
- **User Engagement**: How often users view calendar item details
- **Signup Patterns**: Which events get more signups vs views
- **Error Rates**: How often attendance changes fail
- **Feature Usage**: Which calendar features are most used

## Best Practices

1. **Privacy**: No personally identifiable information is tracked
2. **Performance**: Analytics tracking is optimized to not impact UI performance
3. **Error Handling**: Failed analytics calls don't affect user experience
4. **Data Quality**: Rich context is provided for meaningful analysis

## Migration Notes

The changes are backward compatible and do not affect the component's public API. The analytics functionality is additive and doesn't change existing behavior.
